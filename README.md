## Advent of code Typescript starter template
Advent of Code is an annual online programming event that takes place through the first 25 days of December, with each day featuring a new coding challenge. Participants solve puzzles using their programming skills, while competing (or not) in each challenge. If you want to know more check [their website](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about).

This is a simple typescript template using Deno that you can use to not worry about setting up things just to solve the challenge. just enter your puzzle input in the `input.txt` of the corresponding day and run your code.

Each challenge has the `a` file and `b` file, here is an example on how to run it:
```bash
# npm run <day><a|b>
npm run 1a
```
