## Advent of code Typescript starter template
{Brief explanation of what advent of code is ...}

This is a simple typescript template using Deno that you can use to not worry about setting up things just to solve the challenge. just enter your puzzle input in the `input.txt` of the corresponding day and run your code.
Each challenge has the `a` file and `b` file, to run it you just need to `npm run <day>a` or `npm run <day>b` (E.g. `npm run 1a`).
